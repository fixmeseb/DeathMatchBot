Welcome to the wild and wacky repository of the Historical Death Match Bot! Originally starting over half a decade ago, Historical Death Match has gone through a lot of iterations, but the core design philosophy remains the same: what if historical figures fought each other?

The program uses Discord.py, a heavy amount of python, and the combined brains of the voting populace to answer just who truly is the strongest historical figure.
